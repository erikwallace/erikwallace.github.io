# Scoring Methodology

In 2015, [Cincinnati Magazine ranked the best burgers in the city](http://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/forkopolisblog/how-we-did-it-burger-binge-2015/).  They did such a fantastic job, we decided to take some pointers from them.

That's right, we're going granular.  But we've included some flexibility in the scoring for the overall experience of 3-ways, Cheese Coneys, Toppings, and Execution.

Our standard order will be:  
> A 3-way and a cheese coney all the way

Afterward, each parlor will end up with a score out of **100 points**.
